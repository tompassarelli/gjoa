        #                   what we ship — same correctness, longer build,
        #                   ~5-15% faster runtime. Use only for distribution.

gjoa dev shell — mach is on PATH, env wired for direct iteration.

  COLD START (one-time, or when bumping Firefox version):
    bun run init                 # downloads mozilla-central + applies overlays
    nix build .#gjoa --impure   # produces ./result/bin/gjoa

  DAILY DEV LOOP (sub-30-sec for JS/CSS, few min for C++):
    cd engine
    ./mach build faster          # only re-zips omni.ja
    $MOZ_OBJDIR/dist/bin/gjoa   # run the built binary

  AFTER EDITING src/gjoa/ OR configs/:
    bun run import               # re-applies overlays + branding
    cd engine && ./mach build faster

  TROUBLESHOOTING:
    cd engine && ./mach clobber  # wipe obj-* if state gets confused

  NIX BUILD WHEN:
    - First time on this machine (or after `git clean`)
    - Bumping Firefox version (gjoa.json change)
    - Producing a release artifact for distribution
    - Toolchain change in flake.nix
