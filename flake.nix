        # Firefox bumps its NSS floor faster than nixpkgs ships it (e.g. 151
        # needs 3.123.1 while nixpkgs may still be on 3.123.0). When nixpkgs
        # is behind, we substitute Mozilla's upstream RTM tarball; when it
        # catches up, the overlay short-circuits and we use nixpkgs's
        # nss_latest unchanged.
        #
        # The auto-off uses a two-pass nixpkgs evaluation:
        #   1. Import a bare nixpkgs (no overlays) → basePkgs
        #   2. Compare basePkgs.nss_latest.version against minNssVersion
        #   3. Apply the overlay only when basePkgs is strictly behind
        #
        # This avoids the recursion you hit if you probe `prev.nss_latest`
        # from inside the overlay closure (final↔prev fixed-point).
        #
        # To raise minNssVersion when Firefox needs a newer NSS than the
        # hardcoded floor:
        #   1. Bump minNssVersion to the new requirement
        #   2. Update nssUrl (RTM tarball from
        #      https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/security/nss/releases/) and

gjoa mach shell — full Firefox build toolchain wired in.

  DAILY DEV LOOP (sub-30-sec for JS/CSS, few min for C++):
    bun run import               # re-apply overlays
    cd engine && ./mach build faster

  TROUBLESHOOTING:
    cd engine && ./mach clobber  # wipe obj-* if state gets confused

  NIX BUILD WHEN:
    - First time on this machine (or after `git clean`)
    - Bumping Firefox version
    - Toolchain change in flake.nix
