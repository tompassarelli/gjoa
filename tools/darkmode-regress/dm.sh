# FAST no-build dark-mode iterate. The dark-mode actor (.sys.mjs) and the curated
# fixes (darkmode-fixes.json) are packaged as LOOSE files that the dist tree SYMLINKS
# back into engine/ (dist/bin/modules/<f> -> engine/toolkit/.../<f>), and each fresh
# gjoa launch reads them off disk. So a chrome-actor / fixes change needs NEITHER
# `bun run import` (~30s) NOR `mach build faster` (~37s) — just copy src -> engine and
# render. (C++/Rust/pref/jar changes still need the real build; this is only for the
# dark-mode actor + fixes JSON, which are the hot iteration path.)
#
