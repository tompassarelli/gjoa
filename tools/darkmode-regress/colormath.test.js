/* Deterministic M0 gate for dark-mode v2 (#85): proves the canonical color math
 * (the OKLCH retone + tone-space APCA band-solve) WITHOUT a live site or a build.
 * Run: bun test tools/darkmode-regress/colormath.test.js
 *
 * Each assertion ties to a theorem in docs/darkmode-v2.md: hold-hue (Δh=0),
 * land-in-band, halation ceiling, monotone-in-lightness, polarity conserved,
 * freeze-bg converges / joint solve oscillates. */
