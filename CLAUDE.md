## GJOA DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL — read this first, every session

Firefox rebuilds are expensive (30-60 min cold; 30 sec for omni.ja-only).
The build is too expensive to be part of the thinking loop. Do not use
full rebuilds as a normal feedback loop.

### Classify EVERY change before acting

Before making any change, declare which lane it belongs to:

**Lane 1 — Hot iteration** (no rebuild)
- chrome JS behavior, tab tree logic, command palette
- CSS/layout, prefs, autoconfig/bootstrap loading
- Anything testable via Browser Toolbox or by editing the running profile's chrome/

**Lane 2 — Restart iteration** (`mach build faster` ~30 sec, omni.ja re-zip)
- chrome JS files in src/gjoa/ (after `bun run import`)
- branding text strings (about-logo, brand.ftl, firefox-branding.js)
- about: page logos in omni.ja

**Lane 3 — Full rebuild** (`mach build` 30-60 min, or `nix build .#gjoa` 30-45 min)
- C++/Rust source changes
- New configure flags, mozconfig changes
- Desktop integration icons (default*.png in install tree)
- Binary name, distribution-id
- New patches/ files

### Hard rules

1. **Never run `mach build`, `nix build`, or any full rebuild without an explicit user prompt of the form "run the full rebuild now" or equivalent.** `mach build faster` is fine to run freely.

2. **Do not rebuild to verify.** Verify by reading files, tracing load paths, and checking whether the changed asset is consumed at runtime, package time, or build time. If unsure which lane a change belongs to: investigate first, do not rebuild to find out.

3. **Maintain a rebuild queue.** Track Lane 3 changes in a list. Don't trigger a build per item — batch them. Surface the queue to the user when proposing the next rebuild.

4. **Audit-before-modify on big tasks.** For port/migration work, start with: "Do not modify files. Do not run builds. Produce: (1) files that can be mechanically renamed without rebuild concern, (2) Lane 1+2 candidates, (3) Lane 3 candidates, (4) unknowns needing investigation, (5) proposed first batch."

### Rebuild queue

Pending Lane 3 changes get tracked here (or in TaskCreate). Empty when no work is pending. User reviews and approves before any rebuild runs.

```
[ pending Lane 3 changes — currently empty ]
```

When the user says "kick off the build" / "run the full rebuild now" / equivalent: flush the queue into one rebuild covering all queued changes.

## What this is

Gjoa is a Firefox fork. Source overlays in `src/gjoa/`, branding
in `configs/branding/gjoa/`, build pipeline in `tools/prep/`,
NixOS build via `flake.nix` (uses nixpkgs's `buildMozillaMach`).

The fork was forked from [palefox v0.43.0](https://github.com/tompassarelli/palefox)
— a userscript bundle for Firefox. Gjoa inherits palefox's goals
(keyboard-first chrome, tree tabs, hash-pinned loader baked in) but
implements them as Firefox source-tree files instead of runtime-loaded
`.uc.js` userscripts.

The userscript-era palefox lives at [github.com/tompassarelli/palefox](https://github.com/tompassarelli/palefox)
and is no longer developed. Gjoa is the successor.

## Status

- ✅ Repo scaffold (gjoa.json, flake.nix, tools/prep, dir tree)
- ✅ Build pipeline owned end-to-end (no surfer dependency)
- ✅ First successful `nix build .#gjoa` — produces working binary
- ⬜ Bake the hash-pinned loader from palefox's `program/config.template.js`
     into omni.ja as a JSWindowActor
- ⬜ Port palefox tabs sidebar to `src/gjoa/browser/components/`
- ⬜ Port palefox vim keymap
- ⬜ Distribution + release pipeline + update mechanism

## Reference materials on disk

- `~/code/palefox/archive/` — the userscript-bundle palefox (v0.43.0).
  Source of truth for porting features to gjoa: vim keymap is in
  `chrome/JS/palefox-vim.uc.js`, tab sidebar in `palefox-tabs.uc.js`,
  CSS in `chrome/CSS/`. Loader architecture writeup at
  `archive/docs/dev/loader-pipeline.md`.
- `~/code/zen-browser/` — Zen Browser repo. Reference for how a similar
  fork organizes overlays. We do not depend on their tooling.
- `~/code/firefox/` — mozilla-central source. Reference for Firefox-internal
  types (XPCOM IDLs, JSWindowActor patterns, chrome manifests).

## Naming convention

Everything gjoa-prefixed where prefixes apply:

- CSS variables: `--gjoa-tab-bg`, `--gjoa-sidebar-width`
- Chrome JS files: `gjoa-tabs.uc.js`, `gjoa-vim.uc.js`
- Pref keys: `gjoa.tabs.tree.enabled`, `gjoa.vim.leader-key`
- about: pages: `about:gjoa`, `about:gjoa-config`
- Distribution ID: `org.gjoa` (set in flake.nix)

Long but unambiguous. No abbreviation.

## Workflow

**Two iteration modes:** `nix build` for cold-start / releases (slow,
reproducible). `mach build faster` for daily iteration (sub-30-sec
JS/CSS, few-min C++).

For the deep dive on file types (`.ja`/`.so`/`.cpp`/`.xhtml`), what
`mach build faster` actually does, what PGO/LTO buy you, and the full
dev loop, see [`docs/build-and-dev-loop.md`](docs/build-and-dev-loop.md).

### One-time setup (cold start)

```bash
bun run init                  # download + import (~10 min, ~700MB tarball)
nix build .#gjoa --impure    # ~30-45 min cold compile (dev variant)
./result/bin/gjoa
```

DO NOT run mach bootstrap on NixOS — it doesn't support NixOS as a
distro. nixpkgs's `buildMozillaMach` provides the toolchain instead.

### Daily dev loop (after cold start)

```bash
nix develop                          # enter shell with toolchain + env
# edit src/gjoa/foo.mjs ...
bun run import                       # re-applies overlays + branding
cd engine && ./mach build faster     # ~30 sec, re-zips omni.ja
$MOZ_OBJDIR/dist/bin/gjoa           # run rebuilt binary
```

For C++/Rust changes: `./mach build` (incremental, minutes).
For configure-flag changes: `./mach configure && ./mach build`.

### When to use `nix build .#gjoa` (rare)

- First time on this machine (or after `git clean -fdx`)
- Firefox version bump (gjoa.json change → fresh download → must rebuild from scratch)
- Touched flake.nix toolchain inputs

Otherwise stay in `mach build faster` land — 60-180x faster than
`nix build`.

### Two build variants

```bash
nix build .#gjoa          # DEV — no PGO, no LTO
nix build .#gjoa-release  # RELEASE — full PGO + LTO
```

Default `.#gjoa` is the dev variant. PGO (the 2-pass profile-collect
rebuild) doubles build time at a 5-15% runtime speed cost — invisible
during development. Use `-release` only for distribution artifacts.

### Runtime injection (no rebuild at all)

For exploratory UI work, the v0.43.0 fx-autoconfig pattern still works
inside the fork — drop a `.uc.js` into the running profile's `chrome/JS/`,
restart Firefox. Use this for prototyping; promote to `src/gjoa/`
when stable.

## Common pitfalls

- **`buildMozillaMach` has TWO arg lists.** `pgoSupport`/`ltoSupport`/
  `crashreporterSupport` go through `.override`, not the user args.
  See flake.nix's `mkGjoa` for the pattern.
- **Disk usage is heavy.** mozilla-central source is ~5GB, build outputs
  another ~5GB, downloaded toolchain ~2GB. Plan ~15GB before `bun run init`.
- **`engine/.git/` is intentional.** `tools/prep/patches.ts` initializes it
  so `git apply` works. mach detects it; flake.nix passes `pkgs.git` as a
  build input so the build doesn't fail looking for git.

## Anti-goals

- **Don't depend on surfer (or any external Firefox-fork tooling).** We
  vendored the build pipeline (`tools/prep/`) for a reason — it was the
  only way to keep Zen-isms out of our build. Don't add it back.
- **Don't pre-port palefox v0.43.0's full feature set.** Re-add features
  deliberately, prioritizing the ones that benefit most from being
  source-level (loader, vim keymap, tab tree).
- **Don't write quick-fix scripts that patch surfer's output post-import.**
  We're past that. Add to `tools/prep/branding.ts`'s substitution table
  instead, with a regression test.

## When extending gjoa

- **New gjoa source file:** drop into `src/gjoa/<area>/` mirroring
  the Firefox source-tree path it should overlay.
- **Mozilla source patch:** add as `patches/<NNNN>-name.patch`. Filename
  prefix controls apply order (alphabetical).
- **Default pref:** add to `prefs/gjoa/`. (Not yet wired into the
  pipeline — currently a stub.)
- **New brand string or URL:** add to `gjoa.json` AND to the substitution
  table in `tools/prep/branding.ts`. Add a check that it landed correctly
  in `tests/`.
