# Stewardship topology (GENERATED — do not edit by hand)

> Projection of `tools/scripts/preflight.bjs` (the gate registry) +
> `docs/stewardship/*.md` + `package.json` scripts. Regenerate with
> `bun run stewardship:gen`; drift or a dangling reference fails
> `bun run stewardship:check`. A hand-list would rot — this can't.
